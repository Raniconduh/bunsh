# bunsh
The bun shell. Written in pure lua with the help of luaposix.

## Usage
Bunsh works just like any other shell. (`command arg1 arg2 ...`) As of now it has support for command execution and aliases but no other shell feature (such as pipes).

## Installation
Bunsh requires lua (tested with lua5.3) and [luaposix](https://github.com/luaposix/luaposix).
